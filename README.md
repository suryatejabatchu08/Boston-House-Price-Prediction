# Boston House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices in Boston based on various features such as location, crime rate, number of rooms, and more. It leverages data analysis and regression techniques to build accurate predictive models.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for regression.
- Model evaluation and error analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/suryatejabatchu08/Boston-House-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
3. Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing Dataset, which contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to ensure accuracy and reliability.
